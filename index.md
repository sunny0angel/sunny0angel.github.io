## Welcome to My Github

This is the most important and critical time of all of my 30 years life.

I, as a outsourcing programmer, am aim to be one of the most famous companies of the industry.

However, I lost most of my college knowledge in my outsourcing work.

I must start right now, to catch up with others, to gain my goals.

I decide to start with writing a compiler, maybe it's not so well.

And the next is a program language, the next, OS, and the next, and the next...

Maybe someday, I would disappear from here, then I must have given up my dream and my left life.

I really don't want to see the bad end, and you guys must be the same with me.

SO, I'll do my best to keep my words, please wait for my good news.

Bad end will never happen.
